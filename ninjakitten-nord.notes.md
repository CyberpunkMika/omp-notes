Need to add sections for python, python venv and docker/kubenetes (like night-owl.omp.json).

Possible additional segments:
Docker  
Helm (?)  
Kubernetes  
Terraform (?)  
Lua (?)  
Node (?)  
NBA (?)(possibly try non-NBA codes as see what happens)  
System/Project (https://ohmyposh.dev/docs/segments/system/project)  
System/Root (https://ohmyposh.dev/docs/segments/system/root)  
OpenWeatherMap (https://ohmyposh.dev/docs/segments/web/owm)
