Random notes on the config of an Oh-My-Posh theme file

Sections in a theme file:

Palette (a section that sits alongside blocks, not inside blocks, that defines a list of colours that can then be used in other sections of the file so you don't have to specify Hex colour codes in the rest of the file)

Blocks (the main section of a themes file that contains all the segments that make up the final prompt)

Segments (the individual parts of the final prompt. Some segments will only display under certain circumstances (for example when changing to a folder that is a local git repo))
